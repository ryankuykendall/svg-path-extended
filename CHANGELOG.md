## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-16

### Added

#### Core
- Multi-layer support — `path` layers for SVG paths and `text` layers for text elements with template literals.
- Style blocks as first-class values with merge (`+`), property access (`.fill`), and per-element inline styles.
- Arrays and `null` as first-class data types with `len()`, `push()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `join()`, index access, and spread.
- `for`/`if`/`let` control flow inside text blocks.
- Radians-based text/tspan rotation (converted to degrees at render time).

#### Playground
- Thumbnail system — R2-backed storage, crop modal, landing page thumbnails, admin backfill view, and supersampled rasterization with step-down halving.
- Layer controls panel for toggling visibility and managing multi-layer compositions.
- Inline color picker and TextLayer style editor in the code editor.
- Scoped autocompletion for function parameters and layer keywords.
- Docs sidebar with anchor navigation and scroll spy.
- Export legend improvements — snap-to-grid positioning, advanced settings with font embedding, Baumans branding, compact metadata line, content-driven width, and 128-line code limit.
- Shared SVG snapshot utility for consistent multi-layer rendering across export, thumbnails, and preview.
- Loading spinner on workspace transitions with stale SVG preview clearing.
- Admin token rotation script (`npm run website:admin-token`) with Wrangler secret + redeploy.

#### Documentation
- Layers documentation covering PathLayer, TextLayer, template literals, and style blocks.
- Style blocks and template literals documented in syntax reference.
- Arrays and null documented in syntax reference.
- Conditionals docs updated to include `else if` syntax.
- Blog post: *The SVG Serialization Trap*.

### Fixed

#### Playground
- Navigator viewport stroke vanishing on large canvases.
- Navigator blank for text-only layers (clone text elements for minimap).
- Navigator per-layer styling and viewport-fill zoom for small canvases.
- Overflow menu clipped in workspace cards.
- Empty admin thumbnails — wait for in-progress generation and validate results.
- Thumbnail worker path resolution in production.

### Changed

#### Core
- Deprecated global stroke/fill controls in favor of per-layer styling.

#### Development
- Converted all scripts from JavaScript/Bash to TypeScript with Commander CLI framework for `--help`, argument parsing, and type safety.
- Scripts now run via `tsx` instead of `node`; added `commander` as a dev dependency.
- Added `scripts/CLAUDE.md` prescribing TypeScript + Commander conventions for new scripts.
- Git hook installer (`install-git-hooks.ts`) now writes shims that invoke TypeScript source via `npx tsx`.
- Added `playground/CLAUDE.md` and `src/CLAUDE.md` with conventions and workflow guardrails; refreshed project-level CLAUDE.md for multi-layer era.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-09

### Added

#### Core
- `else if` conditional chains — chain as many `else if` blocks as needed between `if` and `else`.
- `pi` numeric suffix for angle literals (e.g., `0.25pi`, `2pi`) and `mpi(x)` stdlib function for multiplying expressions by pi.
- Variable reassignment support (`x = value;`) — reassign previously declared variables without `let`.
- `toFixed` number precision post-processing — available as a `compile()` option and CLI flag (`--precision`).
- Async interpreter execution via Web Worker (`src/worker.ts`) for non-blocking compilation.

#### Playground
- Export with Legend feature — modal for exporting SVG with a customizable code legend overlay.
- Light/dark theme system with visual refresh and system preference detection.
- Refresh button for recompiling programs that use random functions.
- Persist workspace preferences (canvas size, stroke, fill, grid) on change via autosave service.
- Copy workspace form workflow and increased canvas size limit.
- Toggle publish action on workspace cards.
- Async compilation via Web Worker with performance optimizations.

### Fixed

#### Playground
- Width/height input max validation in footer.
- Console log objects not expandable in console pane.

### Changed

#### Branding
- Playground rebranded to **Pathogen**.

#### Deployment
- Migrated from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages; removed GitHub Actions deploy workflow.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- `arcFromPolarOffset(angle, radius, angleOfArc)` - New context-aware function for drawing arcs where the center is at a polar offset from the current position. Guarantees continuous paths by only emitting `A` commands (never `M` or `L`). Positive `angleOfArc` draws clockwise, negative draws counter-clockwise.
- Context-aware functions documentation in `docs/stdlib.md` covering polar movement, arc functions, and tangent functions.
- Known issue ISSUE-002 documenting M command timing with context-aware functions.
#### Playground
- Autocomplete for the playground CodeMirror editor with snippets, stdlib functions, and context-aware completions.
- Save/load workspace support for `.svgx` files with File System Access API fallbacks and keyboard shortcuts.
- Refactored playground into modular Web Components with shared components, extracted styles, and state store.
- App shell + History API routing with landing, workspace, docs, preferences, and storybook views plus Cloudflare Pages deployment scaffolding.
- Blog feature in the playground with list and post views, markdown rendering, and build/new-post scripts.
- Enhanced component storybook with sidebar navigation, deep links, and interactive demos.
#### Documentation
- Documentation now generated from markdown sources via `scripts/build-docs.js`, including new getting-started/debug content and syntax updates.
- Syntax highlighting for docs using highlight.js (GitHub Dark theme).

#### Development
- Added an optional post-commit hook installer (`scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`) to remind contributors to update `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed

#### Core
- `arcFromCenter` now emits `L` (lineto) instead of `M` (moveto) to reach the arc start point. This keeps paths continuous so that `Z` (closepath) closes to the original path start, not the arc start. If the current position already matches the arc start, only the `A` command is emitted.

#### Deployment
- SPA routing on Cloudflare Pages now supports direct navigation to playground routes via `_worker.js` and a base href update.

### Changed

#### Core
- `arcFromPolarOffset` uses the convention that positive `angleOfArc` is clockwise and negative is counter-clockwise, matching the visual behavior in SVG's Y-down coordinate system.

#### Deployment
- Build output moved to `public/` for Cloudflare Pages auto-detection.

#### Branding
- Page titles updated to include Pedestal Design branding.
